      ## 7 June 3011
      
      The plan for a Steiner raid on the Marik world of Castor began in the mind of Cranston Snord, famous 
      eccentric and one of Katrina Steiner's longstanding mercenary commanders.  Snord's contacts had informed 
      him that a priceless collection of Faberg√© Eggs was on Castor, and he already had a place staked out for 
      them in his private museum on Clinton.
      
      When Morgan and Patrick Kell heard of Snord's intentions, they saw an opportunity to give their fledgling 
      unit its first test in battle.  Because Lyran intelligence had found a cache of illegal atomic weapons on 
      Castor, Katrina Steiner approved the raid to take out the weapons, get Snord his eggs, and give the Kell 
      Hounds some action.
