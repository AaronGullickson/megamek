# Provides backward compatibility for any changes to the unit name.
# If a name is changed, an entry should be made here so that it can still
# be found by a previous name that may appear in a MUL file or a MekHQ
# campaign file. Each entry should be on a separate line and have the
# format "oldname|currentname"
